New Jersey, flashed its first light December 10. 1896. The beacon. which could be seen 15 miles at sea, guided countless mariners in their journeys and contributed to the state's economic growth and helped make sailing through local waters safer.

The lighthouse was built to illuminate a blind spot midway in the38½-mile stretch between Navesink Lighthouse (Twin Lights) to the north and Barnegat Lighthouse to the south. It also served as a land­mark for near by Sea Girt In let and Wreck Pond.

By the early 1900s. there were some 40 light stations - lighthouses. lightships and range lights - along New Jersey's 130-mile coastline. Just over half of them survive. But only 11 of the original lighthouses. including Sea Girt. are open to the public

All who come are invited to spend an enjoyable hour or so going back in time to explore each room of the lighthouse and climb the 42 steps into the tower.

Knowledgeable and enthusiastic guides conduct tours Sundays, 2-4 p.m., except holiday weekends, mid-April through the Sunday before Thanksgiving. Please note: There are no Sunday tours on Mother’s Day, Memorial weekend, Father's Day, July 4 weekend or Labor Day weekend.
