A recent Sunday saw visitors from as far away as Arizona and Hamburg, Germany and as near as a block away.
All who come are invited to spend an enjoyable hour or so going back in time to explore each room of the lighthouse and climb the 42 steps into the tower.
Knowledgeable and enthusiastic guides conduct tours Sundays, 2-4 p.m., except holiday weekends, mid-April through the Sunday before Thanksgiving. Please note: There are no Sunday tours on Motherâ€™s Day, Memorial weekend, Father's Day, July 4 weekend or Labor Day weekend.
However, group tours, popular with schools, scouts and others, are conducted year-round by prior arrangement with the Sea Girt Lighthouse Citizens Committee.
