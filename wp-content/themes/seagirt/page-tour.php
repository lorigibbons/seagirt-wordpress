        <h3>Tours of Sea Girt</h3>
        <p>Sunday tours of the 114-year-old Sea Girt Lighthouse are attracting people of all ages from the immediate area and from across the country and around the world. A recent Sunday saw visitors from as far away as Arizona and Hamburg, Germany and as near as a block away.</p>
        <p>All who come are invited to spend an enjoyable hour or so going back in time to explore each room of the lighthouse and climb the 42 steps into the tower. </p>
        <p>Knowledgeable and enthusiastic guides conduct tours Sundays, 2-4 p.m., except holiday weekends, mid-April through the Sunday before Thanksgiving. Please note: There are no Sunday tours on Motherâ€™s Day, Memorial weekend, Father's Day, July 4 weekend or Labor Day weekend.</p>
        <p>However, group tours, popular with schools, scouts and others, are conducted year-round by prior arrangement with the Sea Girt Lighthouse Citizens Committee. Book your tour today!

        <h3>What You'll See</h3>
        <p>Visitors are guided from the keeper's office into the living quarters and then up the spiral staircase to the lantern room at the top of the tower.</p>
        <p>On display are  photos, documents and other important artifacts that capture the history of the lighthouse, the keepers and their families in the U.S. Lighthouse Service era (1896-1939) and then the Coast Guardsmen who served there (1939-1954). There are also many artifacts from the luxury liner Morro Castle disaster and rescue.</p>
